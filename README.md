## Installing
These dotfiles are managed using a bare repo. Clone it like so:
```
git clone --bare git@github.com:iFreilicht/.dotfiles.git .dotfiles/.git
```
And check out the files like so:
```
git --git-dir=.dotfiles/.git --work-tree=. checkout
```
There's also a `bootstrap.sh` script, but I haven't tested it much. Better you don't use it.

To install all the tools that are required, install nix first.
Then, simply install everything from `tools.nix`:
```
nix-env -if tools.nix
```
