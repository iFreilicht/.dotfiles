# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Which files should be hidden? (regular expression)
set hidden_filter ^\.(?!dotfiles|private-dotfiles|config)|\.(?:pyc|pyo|bak|swp)$|^lost\+found$|^__(py)?cache__$

# Ask for a confirmation when running the "delete" command?
# Valid values are "always", "never", "multiple" (default)
# With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.
set confirm_on_delete multiple

# Use non-default path for file preview script?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.
set preview_script ~/.config/ranger/scope.sh

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text or image previews?
set use_preview_script true

# Be aware of version control systems and display information.
set vcs_aware true

# Use one of the supported image preview protocols
set preview_images true

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
#   This feature relies on the dimensions of the terminal's font.  By default, a
#   width of 8 and height of 11 are used.  To use other values, set the options
#   iterm2_font_width and iterm2_font_height to the desired values.
#
# * terminology:
#   Previews images in full color in the terminology terminal emulator.
#   Supports a wide variety of formats, even vector graphics like svg.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
#
# * kitty:
#   Preview images in full color using kitty image protocol.
#   Requires python PIL or pillow library.
#   If ranger does not share the local filesystem with kitty
#   the transfer method is changed to encode the whole image;
#   while slower, this allows remote previews,
#   for example during an ssh session.
#   Tmux is unsupported.
#
# * ueberzug:
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "ueberzug".
#   Images are shown by using a child window.
#   Only for users who run X11 in GNU/Linux.
set preview_images_method ueberzug

# Use a unicode "..." character to mark cut-off filenames?
set unicode_ellipsis true

# Which colorscheme to use?  These colorschemes are available by default:
# default, jungle, snow, solarized
set colorscheme realsolarized


# Wrap long lines in plain text previews?
set wrap_plaintext_previews true

# Draw the status bar on top of the browser window (default: bottom)
set status_bar_on_top true

# Draw a progress bar in the status bar which displays the average state of all
# currently running tasks which support progress bars?
set draw_progress_bar_in_status_bar true

# Draw borders around columns? (separators, outline, both, or none)
# Separators are vertical lines between columns.
# Outline draws a box around all the columns.
# Both combines the two.
set draw_borders both 

# Display the directory name in tabs?
set dirname_in_tabs true

# Display the file size in the main column or status bar?
set display_size_in_main_column true
set display_size_in_status_bar false

# Set a title for the window? Updates both `WM_NAME` and `WM_ICON_NAME`
set update_title true

# Shorten the title if it gets long?  The number defines how many
# directories are displayed at once, 0 turns off this feature.
set shorten_title 3

# Show hostname in titlebar?
set hostname_in_titlebar false

# How many directory-changes or console-commands should be kept in history?
set max_history_size 50
set max_console_history_size 100

# Try to keep so much space between the top/bottom border when scrolling:
set scroll_offset 4

# Changes case sensitivity for the cd command tab completion
set cd_tab_case smart

# Use fuzzy tab completion with the "cd" command. For example,
# ":cd /u/lo/b<tab>" expands to ":cd /usr/local/bin".
set cd_tab_fuzzy true

# Avoid previewing files larger than this size, in bytes.  Use a value of 0 to
# disable this feature.
set preview_max_size 1000000000

# The delay that ranger idly waits for user input, in milliseconds, with a
# resolution of 100ms.  Lower delay reduces lag between directory updates but
# increases CPU load.
